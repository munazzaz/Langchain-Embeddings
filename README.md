### Development Workflow :bookmark:

| Action                    | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _Feature Branch Creation_ | Create a new `branch` for each feature or fix.                                      |
| _Coding_                  | Adhere to `coding` standards and workspace structure.                               |
| _Code Review_             | Submit `pull requests` to `dev` branch for review before merging.                   |
| _Testing_                 | Do proper `QA testing` with @sakshit and @syed to ensure code quality. |
| _Deployment_              | @Sakshit will merge code into the main branch and deploy to `production`.        |

## Best Practices :rocket:

🌴 Regularly pull changes from the `dev` branch .

🌱 Write unit tests for new `components` and `functions`.

☘️ Perform `code reviews` to maintain code quality.

🎉 Create `feature branches` for new features and fixes.
